More specifically, I will be showing a simple and informative visualization as a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between penguin culmen length and culmen depth.\nFirst, we load the necessary packages and data, as shown below.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndata = \"/Users/andrewhan/PIC16B/posts/Palmer Penguins/palmer_penguins.csv\"\npenguins = pd.read_csv(data)\n\nNext, we will filter our data set to drop any entries with NaN values for their culmen length and/or depth.\nUsing that filtered data, we will group the data based on those categories. Then we will plot the data using the matplotlib package. Using key words, we can choose the type of chart we want, as well as the colors. In this case, I went with a scatter plot with blue dots.\nAfter adding the titles and labels, we can display our data visualization!\n\npenguins_filtered = penguins.dropna(subset = ['Culmen Length (mm)', 'Culmen Depth (mm)'])\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.scatter(penguins['Culmen Length (mm)'], penguins['Culmen Depth (mm)'], c='blue', alpha=0.7)\nplt.title('Scatter Plot of Culmen Length vs Culmen Depth')\nplt.xlabel('Culmen Length (mm)')\nplt.ylabel('Culmen Depth (mm)')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, there is scatter plot with all of our data points (penguins) plotted with their respective culmen length and depth. It seems that there is no identifiable trend between their length and depth measurements as there are many penguins with both proportionally larger culmen lengths and culmen depths."
